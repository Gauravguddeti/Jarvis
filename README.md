# Python Voice Assistant with Spotify Integration

[Project Description]
A Python voice assistant that allows you to perform various tasks using voice commands. The assistant can open web pages, answer questions, and even play songs from Spotify.

## Features
- Voice recognition using the SpeechRecognition library.
- Speech synthesis using the pyttsx3 library.
- Webpage automation for opening websites.
- Spotify integration to search and play songs from Spotify.
- Greeting based on the time of day.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - `SpeechRecognition`
  - `pyttsx3`
  - `spotipy`
  - Other libraries mentioned in the code

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a Spotify Developer Application and obtain the `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `redirect_uri`. Update these credentials in your code.
